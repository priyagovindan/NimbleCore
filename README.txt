HOW TO RUN NimbleCore:
python main_NimbleCore.py <input_file_name>
Example: python main_NimbleCore.py ca-astroph.txt


INPUT:
The input has to an edgelist file, in the same directory as the code. An example graph is included, called "ca-astroph.txt" (From https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ca-AstroPh.html)


OUTPUT:
1. The core number estimated by NimbleCore will be saved in the current directory. 
2. The error of the estimates will be printed as output.
3. The exact core numbers will also be saved in the current directory.
